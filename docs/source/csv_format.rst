CSV Format
===============================

Once the website is set up, you will be prompted to upload a `.csv` file with the responses you want to rate.

The structure of the `.csv` file must follow specific guidelines. Here is an example of the format:

+---------------------+------------------------+
| **Response ID**      | **Response Text**       |
+=====================+========================+
| 1                   | "This is a sample text" |
+---------------------+------------------------+
| 2                   | "Another response here" |
+---------------------+------------------------+

Make sure your CSV file follows this format for the website to correctly process and rate the responses.

**Steps to Upload the CSV**:
