AIHQ Rating Website is a tool designed to help researchers analyze and rate user responses based on models such as GPT-3.5-turbo and fine-tuned Flan-T5-large. This website allows users to upload `.csv` files containing responses and process them through these models to generate ratings based on a pre-defined schema.

The system ensures easy integration with both OpenAI's API (for GPT-3.5) and fine-tuned models, allowing users flexibility in rating large amounts of textual data. The AIHQ Rating Website provides an intuitive interface for uploading CSVs and downloading the rated results after processing.

Below you will find the installation instructions and details about the required CSV file format for this tool.
